The goal of this project was to try to see if it was possible to encode "line-based shapes" (like a letter or a drawing done only with thin lines) by just approximating them by a fourier series. I then look to see if just storing the coefficients to these fourier series can approximate well enough the shapes and see if we can save some memory.

The final conclusion is that it isn't really practical to do (Bezier curves are much better for this problem of storing shapes), but it was fun and interesting to play around with this fourier approach.
